        ip: '%{help}. If this select box is empty, it means you just need to configure a printer in CUPS. As an example, you could do it, for a SMB shared printer, running a command like this: sudo lpadmin -p PrinterName -E -v smb://username:password_urlencoded@WORKGROUP/PRINTSERVER/PRINTER -m raw -L "LOCATION"'
